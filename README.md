# Eesun Moon
I am a Masterâ€™s student in **Computer Science** at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning. Iâ€™ll be joining **Samsung Research America** in Mountain View, California as an **AI Algorithm/NPU Simulator Intern** from June to August 2025. Previously, I earned dual Bachelorâ€™s degrees in **Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering** and **Data Science** from Sejong University in February 2024.

## Publications
At Columbia, I worked on two research projects as a **Research Assistant** (Jan 2025 â€“ May 2025):

- **Sentence Embedding Analysis in LLMs** with Prof. Venkat Venkatasubramanian @ CRIS Lab  
  Explored the structure and interpretability of sentence embeddings in LLMs across layers and domains, evaluating clustering reliability using methods such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and GPT-based approaches.

- **CS Advising Assistant Chatbot with Agentic Flow** with Prof. Vishal Misra  
  Developed a LangChain-based chatbot using DeepSeek and Ollama, deployed on GCP with optimized RAG and agent-based multi-step reasoning.

Previously, I was a **Research Assistant** at the **Mobile Intelligent Embedded System Laboratory** at Sejong University (Sep 2021 â€“ Mar 2024), under **Prof. Hyung Seok Kim**, where I led a project on deep learning-based on-device multimodal emotion recognition.
