# Eesun Moon - ML/AI and Data Science Enthusiast

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at Columbia University, with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing. I also hold a **Bachelor of Engineering** in Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering and Data Science from Sejong University, hold in February 2024.

## Research Interests
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Affective Computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimodal Processing

## Research Experience
I had worked as a **Research Assistant** at the **Mobile Intelligent Embedded System Laboratory** at Sejong University since September 2021. Under the supervision of **Professor Hyung Seok Kim**, I had led several projects in AI and embedded systems, focusing on multimodal emotion recognition, edge computing, and human-robot interaction.
