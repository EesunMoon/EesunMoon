# Eesun Moon

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at Columbia University, with a focus on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing. I received both **Bachelor of Science** in Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering and **Bachelor of Engineering** in Data Science from Sejong University in February 2024.

## Interests
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimodal Processing

## Research Experience
I worked as a **Research Assistant** at the **Mobile Intelligent Embedded System Laboratory** at Sejong University from September 2021 to March 2024, under the supervision of **Professor Hyung Seok Kim**. During this time, I led several projects in AI and embedded systems, focusing on multimodal emotion recognition, edge computing, and human-robot interaction.
